xample in Context:
Let's say you want to allow users to upload profile pictures, and you store them in a temporary folder called temp before moving them to a final location.

Here's how you would use this Multer setup in an Express route:
code 😂

import express from "express";
import { upload } from "./uploadMiddleware.js"; // assuming your multer code is in uploadMiddleware.js

const app = express();

// Route to handle profile picture upload
app.post("/upload", upload.single('profilePic'), (req, res) => {
    res.send("File uploaded successfully");
});

// Start server
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});




What Happens in this Example:
When the user sends a POST request to /upload with a file named profilePic, Multer will handle the file upload.
Multer will:
Store the file in the ./public/temp directory.
Save the file with its original name (file.originalName).
After the upload, the route will respond with a success message.
Key Terms:
req: Represents the HTTP request.
file: Represents the file being uploaded.
cb: A callback function used by Multer to confirm the destination and filename.
